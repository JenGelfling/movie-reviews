### UX

A new visitor to the site can search for movies and see reviews of movies. If someone wants to post a review themselves, they can sign up or log back in using their credentials. They are then allowed to post a new review of any move and give it a score.

## Files

- HTML:
    - index.html: The landing page where a user can get rules and signup for our email list, so we can tell them about updates and new games. This landing is also where the user navigates to the War game itself, choosing a color (red or black) in the process.
    - cardtable.html: The gameplay page where a user plays War, as the color they chose before. If they were in the middle of a game, the game is saved for them to continue.
